In this project we are trying to make our own version of the nostalgic retro game **PacMan** using the power of **Object Oriented Programming** and **Java** as one of the most frequently used Object Oriented Programming languages.

As for the graphics, we will use **JavaFX** as a software platform designed to deliver desktop applications.

Data is also handled by a local database accessed by **SQLite3** (Structured Query Language).
