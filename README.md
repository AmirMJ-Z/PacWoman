</a>

In this project, we are trying to make our own version of the nostalgic retro game **PacMan** using the power of **Object Oriented Programming** and **Java** as one of the most frequently used Object Oriented Programming languages.

As for the graphics, we will use **JavaFX** as a software platform designed to deliver desktop applications.

Data is also handled using a local database accessed by **SQLite3** (Structured Query Language).

Ghosts movements are designed using **Path Finding Algorithms** to find the shortest path to the player.

> The *Grey* ghost finds the shortest path to the PacMan and follows it. The *Yellow* and *Red* ghosts get close to the PacMan (within a particular radius) and then perform random movements. The *Green* ghost moves completely randomly.
